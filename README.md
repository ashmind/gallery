See [Peer-to-browser photo sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_sharing#Peer-to-browser_photo_sharing) for the basic description of the idea.

Please do not view this as a sample application or an example of best practices. It is completely practical, and in some places I have taken shortcuts I haven't yet enough time to fix.
